# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to examine the fares by riders to driers in various population settings (urban, rural, suburban, etc.). Additionally, there is a time analysis of the total fares by city type. 

## Results:

In general, urban drivers had the highest fares in an analysis of 1/1/19 to 4/28/19 data compared to rural and suburban drivers. In second place for highest fares was suburban which leaves rural as the lowest suty type for total fares on a time series average. Oddly, there is also the highest number of drivers in the urban city type, seconded by suburban and lastly by rural. Incoincidentially, the average fare per ride in each of the city types was rural, followed by suburban, and lasted by urban. 

## Summary:

Some business recommendations are to 11 put more urban drivers on the road to decrease the fare per ride, 2. perhaps increase the difference in fares between the types of city, and lastly, 3. we are not sure why 'New Years' Day 2019' was the lowest fare total for the urban city type during that period analysis. There might be value to unlock.
